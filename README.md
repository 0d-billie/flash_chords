# Flash Chords

#### An application designed to help learn guitar chords in their various positions.

This is the first webapp I've made, and the code's pretty messy. I intend to do a refactor soon, and possibly move over to Node and Express.
All chord diagrams are generated using SVG.js, rather than using images.


### To Do:

- Centre position buttons
- General code review and cleanup

### Planned features:

- User submitted chords
- Audio playback
- Show musical notation for chords instead of names
- Be able to select a pool of chords to learn
- Other tunings

### Technologies used:

[jQuery]
[SVG.js]
[Chords DB]
[Semantic UI]

# Flash Chords

#### An application designed to help learn guitar chords in their various positions.

This is the first webapp I've made, and the code's pretty messy. I intend to do a refactor soon, and possibly move over to Node and Express.
All chord diagrams are generated using SVG.js, rather than using images.


### To Do:

- Centre position buttons
- General code review and cleanup
- Tap anywhere on card to reveal
- Keyboard control
- Fix known issue with barring

### Planned features:

- User submitted chords
- Audio playback
- Show musical notation for chords instead of names
- Be able to select a pool of chords to learn
- Other tunings
- Chord search

### Technologies used:

[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)  
[SVG.js](http://svgjs.com)  
[Chords DB](https://github.com/tombatossals/chord-db)  
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)  
[Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/)
